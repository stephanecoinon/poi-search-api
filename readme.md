# POI Search API

Playing around with [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com) and
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to build an API to search for POIs (Points Of
Interest) nearest to a given UK postcode.

We'll use the [Open Charge Map](http://openchargemap.io/site) as the map data and
MongoDB built-in geo-location search to find the nearest points to a given UK
postcode. And we'll leverage [Postcodes.io](http://postcodes.io) to geo-locate
the searched postcodes.

I'll explain how to set it all up on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
so you can reuse this project to build an API with your own data source.
